This is my wishlist for an F# ReSharper type thing.
Don't really need that much as F# removes the need for many things!

Rename value refactoring.
- Include changing names in failwith strings etc.
Goto type/definition (search box one)
Find usages.
Optimise "open"s
Implement members (creating derived class)

Comment block (VS support this?)
Show method sig help (VS support this?)
Show documentation (VS support this?)
Highlight matched parens (can VS do this?)
